Questions like _What's the best path to learn developer ?_ nor _What's the quickest way to be bankable/employable ?_

There are trick questions, and I don't think it should be answered!

# No method - No format

There is no better way to learn, there is no better format, I think everyone is unique and has different learning needs, and different life paths.

The big mistake we make, in the school system, is that we think that we have to be formatted, that we think that there is a _good_ way to learn and to do, and that if we crash or make a mistake at some point we will never get out of it or never fall back on our steps,
this is not true at all.

In my company there are peoples who all have very different stories, and what I learned over time, you have to know how to trust yourself, accept that you
are unique, that you are going to have a unique life course.

# So, what's the best way to become developer ?

I could respond by providing my personal list of the best resources to learn an astronomical amount of content, for free, but I'll save that for a future article.
However, I think the correct answer is :

- Do whatever you like !
- Do the thing that you would like to create !
- Do the thing that makes you want at this moment !

**No matter the language** (Even if the language is obsolete or little used or not modern, who cares) ! What matters is to take the step
progressive of `doing things`. This somewhat `hacker-mindset` side you have to have it from the start if you want to create things.

So go ahead, get started if your goal is to make a minecraft server, well you're going to need this or that language and you're bound to learn as you go.

It's because you're going to like modify your Minecraft server, you're going to spend hours and hours learning the specifics of the `Java` language, which you would never normally do because it really bores you, and then suddenly it gets exciting because you have a project to carry out.

Do what you like, spread love. Have a good day ðŸ‘‹
