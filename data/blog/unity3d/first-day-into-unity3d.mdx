Hello there! üëã I always dreamed about designing and developing my own video games. But never found the required times to learn the
essential skills to make my dream come true.

But this time is OVER! I'm starting to learn Unity3D today only with free resources ‚≠ê

# My background

I'm Maxime Kubik, and I'm 27 years old. I'm a software developer (full-stack) working for the manufacturing industry. I build custom software packages
and business applications every day. I'm also a gamer, but never did any game development ever!
I don't know anything about indie game culture or about Unity3D.

# What is Unity ?

Unity is a game development framework. It's software that allows you to create games and 3D applications. It's a great tool to learn and one of the most simple to use as
a software developer. We mostly use `C#` to develop scripts. Folks say it's `extremely easy to use` ... I'm not sure about that. Let's talk about it in 2 months maybe üòÇ

Internet says the learning curve to master **Unity** takes approximately 3 to 9 months (full-time maybe..). I love to learn, so I'm going to try to learn it.

Unity is used by some of the biggest names in the industry like:

- _Monument Valley_
- _Temple run_
- _Angry Birds_

For indie developers, Unity is game-changing as it means they can compete with much bigger companies.
You can download **Unity** on their official website:

# Where can we learn Unity for free?

I started my learning journey on the [Unity Learning Platform](https://learn.unity.com/) and I can only advise you to check it out. ‚ö°

**Unity Learning Platform** is an award-winning tutorials, hands-on projects, and in-depth courses platform. You can access over **750 hours**
of on-demand learning content and live learning sessions for creators at every skill level.

## How to access the learning platform

You need to go to the [Unity Learning Platform](https://learn.unity.com/) website and create an account. It's free, and it's easy with Google Auth. The account is needed
to track your progress and to access the learning content.

## How to access the learning content

You need to register to a **Pathways**. There are 4 big pathways:

- **Unity Essentials** _(~2 weeks)_
- **Junior Programmer** _(~12 weeks)_
- **Creative Core** _(~10 weeks)_
- **VR Development** _(~6 weeks)_

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    ![Unity3D-01](/static/images/unity3d/001/pathways.jpg)
  </div>
</div>

Each pathway have **Mission checkpoints** and **XP Points**. You'll get a **Badge** after completing your pathway. And to reward you,
Unity gives you the possibility to unlock free assets from their assets store :

- [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)

I chose the **Unity Essentials** pathway which is the most advised pathway for beginners to get started.

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    ![Unity3D-01](/static/images/unity3d/001/pathway-essentials.jpg)
  </div>
</div>

## Where should i start?

There is plenty of tutorials on Unity Learning, but i advise you to start from the **Unity Essentials Pathway**

They advise learning the basics from what they call `Unity's Microgames`. And they are right! Unity's Microgames are your go-to for getting started with Unity.

The `in-editor` tutorials will help you build, play, and share your very first game in no time. Learn within Unity Editor (no second screen necessary!)
with step-by-step instructions that highlight each tool and progress after you complete each task.

You will discover 3 game genres:

- FPS üî´
- Racing game üèé
- Platformer üïπ

## Look at my first journey on Unity 3D

This screenshot shows Unity MicroGame platformer to see how assets/scripts work together :

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    ![Unity3D-01](/static/images/unity3d/001/unity-01.png)
  </div>
</div>

I still can't create a game after this first journey, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it in the future.
Working in public will help me to keep learning! I can't wait to share Unity tips!
