summary: What you should you tell and share to a beginner developer, like what the best way to learn?

Questions like 'What's the best path to learn webdev?' or 'What's the quickest way to be bankable/employable?'
There are trick questions, and I don't think it should be answered! Why? My though.

# No method - No format

There is no better way to learn, there is no better format, I think everyone is unique and has different learning needs, and different life paths.

The big mistake we make, in the school system (I'm talking about the French system), is that we think that we have to be formatted, that we think that there is
we think that there is a *good* way to learn and to do, and that if we crash or make a mistake at some point we will never get out of it or never fall back on our steps,
this is not true at all.

In my company there are peoples who all have very different stories, and what I learned over time, you have to know how to trust yourself, accept that you
are unique, that you are going to have a unique life course.

# So what can we share ?

I think the correct answer are :
- Do whatever you like !
- Do the thing that you would like to create !
- Do the thing that makes you want at this moment !

No matter the language, (Even if the language is obsolete or little used or not modern, who cares). What matters is to take the step
progressive of `doing things`. This somewhat `hacker-mindset` side you have to have it from the start if you want to create things.

So go ahead, get started if your goal is to make a minecraft server or a discord bot, well you're going to need such and such a language and you're bound to
learn as you go.

It's because you're going to enjoy modifying your minecraft server, that you're going to spend hours and hours learning the specificity of the `Java` language, which you would never have done
normally because it really pisses you off, then suddenly it becomes exciting because you have a project to carry out.
