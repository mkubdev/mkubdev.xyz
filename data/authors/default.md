Hi, i'm Maxime Kubik ! Welcome here. ðŸŽ© This blog serves as a playground for me to experiment with ideas and share some of my findings. It's a reflection of my career path and interests - especially on the technical side of things. Add me to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximekbk).

I'm musician, web3 builder, and software engineer based in Lyon, France. I'm currently working at [TFTLabs - Innovative Digital Solutions](https://tftlabs.fr) as Fullstack Software Engineer from 2019.

This is the first version of my website. I'm currently working on it, but it's not finished yet. I'll be adding more features soon.

Feel free to reach me on my socials networks to work/hack together!
